# 100-Rounds

This old game made for fun was made while learning Python to experience with the language. The goal is to progress through the rounds by dodging the incoming projectiles, with a boss every 10 rounds.
This game is not finished (at all), only the 15 first rounds are developped yet.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need a python compiler with tkinter included to run this project.
The sound is only available on windows (it was not made portable) (if you use another OS, you will need to delete the lines concerning the sound)
This project has been made for french users : Each button or indication in the programs will indeed be in french. Traductions will be done below.

### Playing

In order to play this game, you will have to naviguate inside the red square to dodge different projectiles with the keyboard arrows. The rounds are getting more and more difficult as you run through them.
